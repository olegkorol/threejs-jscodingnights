Small Three.js Prototype build on the JS Coding Night Meetup in Munich ;)

# Winter Wonderland - with Three.js

[Three.JS API Documentation](https://threejs.org/docs)
[Three.JS Examples](https://threejs.org/examples/)

## Getting started
Clone and install this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/jscodingnights/winter-wonderland.git
cd winter-wonderland
npm install
npm start
```

Then open your browser to the webpack-dev-server URL, likely [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

## Project Challenge
Get artistic: render a winter wonderland!

### Make a snowman
Rendering a snowman will teach you simple geometry, playing with circles, squares, and cones.  Use these simple shapes to build a snowman with optional eyes, a nose, hat etc.

### Let it snow!
Making snow is an intro to particle rendering.  [This example](https://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/Particle-Engine.html) may be helpful.  I also included an image of a snowflake.

### Put it in motion
Put your scene in motion, playing with dynamic camera movements.

You try one/both of:
1) Rotate or fly through your scene by manually controlling the camera
2) Use the OrbitControls
